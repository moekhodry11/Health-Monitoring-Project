# Health-Monitoring-Project
 This repository contains the code and documentation for a health monitoring system using NodeMCU ESP8266, MAX30102 sensor, LM35 sensor, and integration with a web page and a Telegram bot. The system collects vital signs data and sends it to a web page for real-time monitoring. In case of an emergency, it alerts a Telegram bot to notify the relevant parties. Additionally, the system generates a monthly report for doctors to review the historical data.

# Features:
- Real-time monitoring of vital signs including heart rate, blood oxygen level, and temperature
- Integration with a web page for data visualization and remote monitoring
- Alert system that notifies a Telegram bot in case of emergency
- Monthly report generation for doctors to analyze patient data

# Components Used:
- NodeMCU ESP8266: Microcontroller for data collection and communication
- MAX30102 sensor: Measures heart rate and blood oxygen level
- LM35 sensor: Measures temperature
- Web page: Provides a user interface for real-time monitoring and data visualization
- Telegram bot: Receives emergency alerts and sends notifications

# Folder Structure:
- Arduino_Code: Contains the Arduino code for the NodeMCU ESP8266
- Web_Page: Includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the web page
- Documentation: Contains detailed documentation, circuit diagrams, and setup instructions
