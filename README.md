# Health-Monitoring-Project
 This repository contains the code and documentation for a health monitoring system using NodeMCU ESP8266, MAX30102 sensor, LM35 sensor, and integration with a web page and a Telegram bot. The system collects vital signs data and sends it to a web page for real-time monitoring. In case of an emergency, it alerts a Telegram bot to notify the relevant parties. Additionally, the system generates a monthly report for doctors to review the historical data.
